# ShadowChrome Usage Policy

ShadowChrome is a research and educational project that demonstrates how a browser extension can embed a self-contained
Shadowsocks client. The maintainers share the code to encourage learning, auditing, and experimentation with modern web
platform capabilities. By cloning or distributing this repository you agree to the following principles:

1. **Experimental software.** ShadowChrome is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. It has not undergone a formal
   security audit and may contain defects that impact performance, privacy, or stability. Evaluate the source code and behaviour
   in controlled environments before relying on it.
2. **Lawful and ethical use only.** The project is not designed or endorsed for bypassing lawful censorship, corporate access
   controls, or any security measures imposed by network owners. Do not deploy ShadowChrome in ways that violate local laws,
   contractual obligations, or acceptable use policies.
3. **Research focus.** Treat ShadowChrome as a case study for browser-based networking. Use it to explore Manifest V3 APIs,
   practise auditing AI-generated code, or prototype new ideas. Production deployments that expose others to risk are outside the
   scope of this project.
4. **Respect for third parties.** When connecting to Shadowsocks servers, ensure you have permission to use the credentials and
   that the traffic you send complies with the provider's rules. Do not redistribute access keys without explicit consent.
5. **Security diligence.** Keep your development environment patched, run `npm run lint` before contributing changes, and monitor
   upstream dependencies for advisories. If you discover a vulnerability, disclose it responsibly to the maintainers.

By continuing to use ShadowChrome you acknowledge these conditions and accept full responsibility for how you and your
collaborators interact with the software.
